# SkulltherMod-NewDimensionsandMore
A mod for Minecraft that has only textures so far.  Help would be greatly appreciated.
Textures will be posted regularly in a .zip titled "image_batch(number in sucession, starting with 1)."
It also contains text files exlaining the new item's purposes and what they should do.
Crafting recipies will be made over time and updated within a file called "crafting_recipies.zip".




I hope programmers will help me make my dream of making this mod a reality. -HeroOfFire45, co-owner of the Skullther Mod concept and owner of the Skullther Mod.
